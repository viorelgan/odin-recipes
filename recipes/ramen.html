    <h1>Ramen - Naruto</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>When I was big into Naruto, those hot steaming bowls of ramen seemed like the absolute perfect meal.  However, back then, 
        I didn’t understand the difference between those, and what came out of Top Ramen packets. </p>
    
    <p> Now, I’m still using the Top Ramen noodles, but I’ve added a lot more traditional ramen elements.  
        And even if the noodles and stock aren’t 110% authentic, it’s still delicious.  Believe it! </p>
    
    <p>  (If you’re really looking for a from-scratch-as-traditional-as-you-can-get, 
        I’m planning on making up that recipe a bit later.  Be forewarned, it’s a bit time consuming) </p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 Packages of Top Ramen</li>
        <li>About 5 cups of pork or beef broth </li>
        <li>Pork tenderloin</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li> Baby bok choy</li>
        <li>1 Green onion</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <h3>Optional</h3>
        <li>Aburage </li>
        <li>Nori </li>
        <li>Kamaboko</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the tenderloin for at least 3 hours. You can use just soy sauce, or a mixure of whatever other Asian sauces you want.  
            Teriyaki would be good, as would some mirin.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450, then cook the tenderloin for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked all the way through.</li>
        <li>Put your eggs in a pot with enough water to cover them.  Bring to a boil and cover with a lid.  
            It should take about 10 minutes to hard boil the eggs.  
            then pull them out and put them into a bowl of cold water to cool.</li>
        <li>While this is happening, pour or mix the stock/broth in a pot and bring it to a simmer.  You can add soy sauce or mirin to taste.</li>
        <li>Once simmering, add the Top Ramen noodles.  Do NOT add in the flavor packets.  Let that cook.</li>
        <li>Now, we cut up all the toppings!  Peel the eggs and slice them in half, cut the pork,  kamaboko, bok choy, aburage, and green onion into thin slices.</li>
        <li>Serve up the noodles and broth in a nice deep bowl, then place all the ingredients in groups on top, and add in a few small rectangles of nori.  <strong>Itadakimasu!</strong>!</li>
    </ol>
